Chapter 1: AWS AI ML Stack

+ Amazon SageMaker

Is an end-to-end machine learning platform that lets you build, train, tune, and deploy models at scale.
SageMaker provides features through every step in the typical machine learning lifecycle.

Amazon SageMaker Features:
Machine Learning phases: PREPARE, BUILD, TUNE-TRAIN, DEPLOY
Prepare: GroundTruth, Data Wrangler, Processing, Feature Store, Clarify.
Build: Notebooks, Studio, Autopilot, Jumpstart.
Tune-Train: Managed Training, Experiments, Tuning, Debugger, Spot Training.
Deploy: Managed Endpoints, Model Monitor, Pipelines.

Analyzing and Preprocessing Data
Generally, the tool of choice for developing code that can help prepare data is an IDE. and more commonly a Jupyter Notebook.
A notebook contains a mix of Markdown and runnable code that records outputs of each runnable cell.
Once you are done experimenting with code on a notebook, it is also typical to perform the same preprocessing in stand-alone Python code.

SageMaker Notebook Instance
Is a managed ML compute instance running the Jupyter server. 
A notebook instance can be created from SageMaker console or using the CreateNotebookInstance API.
SageMaker creates network interface in the chosen VPC, associates security group.
SageMaker launches notebook in the VPC and enables traffic.
SageMaker installs common ML packages and frameworks.
SageMaker runs any lifecycle configuration script tha you define.
Scripts can be used to pull the latest updates from a Git repository, mount a shared drive, or download data and packages.
SageMaker attaches an EBS storage volume (size between 5 GB and 16 TB).
Files stored inside the /home/ec2-user/SageMaker directory persist between notebook sessions (between turn on and off notebooks).
Scheduling a notebook to be turned off during idle times is important to reduce costs.
For previous, using lifecycle configuration scripts or via Lambda functions.
